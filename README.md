 #I have made a Railway Reservation System app. This aids new passengers to register on the website, book their tickets, cancel their booked tickets and even print their ticket. A passenger can book multiple tickets for various trains and pay for them (payment is not actual). One can search for trains by entering their source, destination and date of travel. 
 #This application has log in, log out facility. It also gives passengers a list of available trains, their journey duration and their source, destination, train number, etc. A person can keep track of his/her booked tickets too. A person can book multiple passengers at a time for different or same trains and also pay simultaneously. A person can delete a booking in the list before payment also. 
 #In all this code is a try to simulate actual Railway Management System to aid a simple interface to an ordinary user and make his/her journey simple and safe!
#This code uses Django in its backend, HTML,CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap in the frontend and MYSQL to manage the database.
